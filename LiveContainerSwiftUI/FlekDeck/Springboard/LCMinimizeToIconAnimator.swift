//
//  LCMinimizeToIconAnimator.swift
//  LiveContainerSwiftUI
//
//  The way iOS closes an app, for the built-in pages: the page shrinks into its
//  own springboard icon with its corners rounding off to the icon's, the grid
//  behind it settles forward out of a slight zoom, and the icon it lands on
//  takes a bounce at the moment it arrives.
//
//  Everything here runs off ONE number — `flightDuration`, how long a window
//  takes to cross in either direction. The critically damped spring that carries
//  it is derived from that, per flight, so that each direction's own finish
//  lands exactly on it: a closing window is done when it matches its icon, an
//  opening one when it has all but reached full size. Opening and closing are
//  therefore the same speed by construction, on every screen, rather than by two
//  numbers kept in agreement by hand. Page, corners and grid all move on the
//  flight's spring.
//
//  The icon's bounce is fired by watching where the window actually is, not by a
//  timer that predicts it — which is what keeps the parts in step on a slow
//  device, a dropped frame or a 120Hz display alike.
//
//  The handoff — the page's last frame and the icon's first — is placed where
//  the two are the same size on screen, so neither jumps as one becomes the
//  other. See `handoffProgress(finalScale:iconPeak:)`.
//
//  Used wherever Settings or the Installer returns to the home screen — the
//  multitask home button, the installer's own close button, and the full-screen
//  cover the pre-multitask path presents them in.
