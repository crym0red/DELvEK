//  Game Center identifies a game by the code signature of the process asking,
//  which for a guest is LiveContainer's. The guest's own bundle identifier never
//  reaches gamed — NSBundle is patched inside the process, the daemon reads the
//  signature over XPC — so the server is asked about a descriptor no Game Center
//  title matches and answers 5019, surfaced as GKErrorGameUnrecognized.
//
//  Nothing can be done about that from in here: authenticating as the real game
//  would take a process signed as the real game. What can be fixed is the shape
//  of the failure. An app told its Game Center app is unrecognised tends to
//  treat that as broken and stop; an app told nobody is signed in carries on
//  without it, because that happens to ordinary players every day. Report the
//  second, and leave the local player unauthenticated, which it genuinely is.
