//
//  LCGuestPiP.m
//  LiveContainer
//
//  Sends a multitask guest's Picture in Picture requests to the host, because
//  the guest cannot serve them itself.
//
//  A guest's own AVPictureInPictureController starts happily in multitask — the
//  window appears, with the system's transport controls, and the audio keeps
//  playing — but the video is never anything but black. The content of a PiP
//  window is a FrontBoard scene that SpringBoard creates with the requesting
//  process as its scene client, and a LiveProcess guest cannot be one:
//
//      [com.apple.pegasus.pictureinpicture:…] Failed to resolve a scene client
//      provider: FBProcessManager code 1 ("not-supported") — "RunningBoard does
//      not support directly launching xpcservice<…LiveProcess…>[extension][client]"
//      → Update failed: FBSceneErrorDomain code 1 "No scene client exists"
//
//  Nothing here can change that answer. It is not about entitlements or scene
//  settings: the classification comes from the guest being an app extension
//  spawned through NSExtension, which is the only way the host can start a guest
//  process at all, and the refusal is decided inside SpringBoard. The trick that
//  gives the guest its main window — registering its audit token with
//  FBProcessManager — only registers it in the host's process, and there is no
//  equivalent reach into SpringBoard's.
//
//  The host, being an ordinary installed app, has no such trouble: its own PiP
//  scene resolves and renders. So the guest's request is swallowed here and
//  handed across, and the host floats the window instead.
//
//  The app is then told its PiP started, which is both true enough and necessary:
//  its video layer really is floating, and an app left believing its request
//  failed tears the session down seconds later, taking with it the playback
//  delegate the host needs to drive play, pause and skip. Its inline UI shows a
//  "playing in picture in picture" placeholder, exactly as it would under a real
//  PiP, and that costs nothing here because what floats is the video layer rather
//  than a picture of the app's window.
//
//  Installed during bootstrap, before the app binary is dlopened, and only for a
//  LiveProcess guest: an app running in single mode is a real app process, its
//  own PiP works properly, and none of this applies to it.
