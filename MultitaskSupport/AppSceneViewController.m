#pragma mark - App group staging

// A private app's bundle and data container live in FlekDeck's own
// container, which LiveProcess cannot read, so both are staged into the app
// group before the guest starts and the container is brought back when it
// exits.
//
// This used to be remove-then-copy run inline on the main thread. Both halves
// scale with the number of files rather than their size, so an app with a large
// asset tree froze the UI for seconds at each end — which is why big games and
// media-heavy apps felt so much worse to open and close than small ones, and
// why the window animation stuttered. Measured on a 20k-file tree: a recursive
// remove is ~610ms and NSFileManager's copy ~1660ms, against ~140ms to clone
// the tree and ~0.1ms to rename it.
//
// So nothing here removes or copies a tree on the path the user is waiting on:
// trees are cloned into place, displaced by a rename, and deleted later.

// Serial: two windows opening at once would otherwise race on the same staged
// bundle, and each stage is short enough that serialising them costs nothing.
